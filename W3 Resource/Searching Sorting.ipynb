The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list.

Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items.
